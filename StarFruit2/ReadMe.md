## Rules

1 Arguments and Options come from either properties or parameters
1 SubCommands come from type, probably with context


## Notes

* Focus should be on the class and method declaration, not the syntax tree itself because there 
are two ways to gather then, via the syntax tree and via visitors on the generator. Focusing 
on class/method keeps this question open.
